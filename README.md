# Forest-Fire-Prediction
Forest Fire Prediction Project  This project is designed to predict the occurrence and spread of forest fires using machine learning and data analysis techniques. By leveraging meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, along with geographical data, the project aims to develop a robust predictive model.
