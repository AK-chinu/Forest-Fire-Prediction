Forest Fire Prediction


Project Overview
Forest fires are a significant environmental concern, causing destruction to ecosystems and posing risks to human lives and property. Predicting forest fires can help in taking preemptive actions to mitigate their impact. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood and extent of forest fires based on various environmental factors.

The goal of this project is to create a robust model that can predict forest fire occurrences using historical data and to provide insights into the key factors influencing these fires.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the dataset to understand the distribution of features and the relationships between them.
Modeling: Implement various machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, to predict forest fires.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Feature Importance: Analyze the importance of different features in predicting forest fires.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information on various environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, along with the recorded instances of forest fires. The data is sourced from [specify source, e.g., Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository] and is included in the repository.
